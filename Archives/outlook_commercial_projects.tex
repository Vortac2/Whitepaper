\subsection{Commercial Projects}

If it is possible to reward users for running specific code on their computers with cryptocurrency, they could also run commercial simulations on their computers basically for free as they are already rewarded by the newly generated cryptocurrency. This would make it possible to offer computing-intensive services much cheaper than is possible now.\\

If a particular commercial project should struggle to get users on board because it is boring or too much ressource intensive requiring special hardware setups, following could be thinkable:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The commercial project buys a given set of Gridcoins on exchanges
	\item The project registers CPIDs of users interested in joining along with a user's gridcoin address for payouts
	\item Registered users do work for the commercial project and submit results to the BOINC server of the project
	\item Registered users receive the usual Proof of Research payout issued by the Gridcoin network
	\item Registered users receive an additional payout done by the commercial project as incentive to enhance and mantain their ressource intensive setup. The payout is done using Gridcoins bought in step 1. to the previously collected users's gridcoin addresses.
\end{enumerate}
