\subsection{Gridcoin Security}

Gridcoin security relies on the fact that Gridcoin is an Open Source derivate of Bitcoin: it inherits Bitcoin's security which is unbroken since creation of Bitcoin. Gridcoin Proof of Stake is the hardened Blackcoin version [44], more secure than Peercoin [2].\\ 

If a BOINC account is hacked and its owner is unaware of Gridcoin, so that its email, password and CPID are known to the attacker, the attacker can receive gains of the unaware BOINC user by sending a beacon with the compromised CPID linked to the attacker's wallet, collecting gridcoins for work done by a BOINC user unaware of gridcoin existence.\\

However, although unfortunate, the previous event will never disrupt the inherently secure transactional mechanism of Gridcoin's blockchain ensuring that people holding and transactions stay secure. Gridcoin blockchain is operating smoothless since 2014 and there were never events which disrupted the way Gridcoin operates. As any other cryptocurrency, Gridcoin remains vulnerable to a 51\% attack though it made it more difficult to exploit, but a vibrant community around Gridcoin stays vigilant and will make sure this will never happen.\\

In [59] a group of security researchers found two attacks which could be exploited on Gridcoin client version 3.5.8. Gridcoin clients with version 3.6.0 and above implement the new Gridcoin PoS Kernel v8 [60] which prevents both exploits described in [59].\\

Additionally, in Gridcoin there will never be an ASIC race as in Bitcoin, because of the scientific nature of the computations which is not easily replicated in FPGA or ASIC machinery. This will ensure Gridcoin will distribute rewards among miners in a more democratic manner than Bitcoin and will avoid tendency to centralization as seen in Bitcoin.
