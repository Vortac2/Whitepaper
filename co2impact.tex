\subsection{CO2 impact}

We calculate emissions from electricity generation based off figures from the EPAâ€™s eGRID emission factors based on 2012 data published in 2015.  On average, electricity sources emit 0.554 kg CO2 per kWh (0.5925 metric tons CO2 per MWh). State CO2 emissions per kWh may vary greatly in accordance with the amount of clean energy in the energy supply (Vermont: 0.002495 kg/kWh ; North Dakota: 0.938255 kg/kWh ). [30]\\

Using the above mentioned averaged factor and the calculations done in the previous subsection, we calculate the CO2 impact for the following frameworks regardless of their size and purpose:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Bitcoin: 55.661 TWh/year = 32.94 millions metric tons CO2 per year
  \item Ethereum: 5.5 TWh/year = 3.26 millions metric tons CO2 per year
  \item BOINC: 0.307 TWh/year = 0.18 millions metric tons CO2 per year
  \item Gridcoin: 0.045 TWh/year =  0.027 millions metric tons CO2 per year
\end{itemize}

//TODO: find some things to compare which also produce 32 millions metric tons per year. It has to be something ugly.
