\subsection{CO2 impact}

We calculate emissions from electricity generation based off figures from the EPAâ€™s eGRID emission factors based on 2012 data published in 2015.  On average, electricity sources emit 0.554 kg CO2 per kWh (0.5925 metric tons CO2 per MWh). State CO2 emissions per kWh may vary greatly in accordance with the amount of clean energy in the energy supply (Vermont: 0.002495 kg/kWh; North Dakota: 0.938255 kg/kWh).\\ [30]
