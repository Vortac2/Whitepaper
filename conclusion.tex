\section{Conclusion}

In this technical whitepaper we first introduced BOINC software to perform scientific computations and the Gridcoin wallet. We gave a brief overview of the underlying blockchain technology and explained how Proof of Stake in combination with Proof of Research is used to reward BOINC researchers with Gridcoin. We gave an estimation of Gridcoin and Bitcoin power consumption and we saw that Gridcoin is way more power efficient because in Gridcoin the consumed energy is used to advance scientific reseach for the benefit of mankind, while in Bitcoin it is all invested in inverting a meaningless hash function. Finally, in the outlook section, we explored the concept of Gridcoin funded science, an improvement to Gridcoin which could spark the next big scientific revolution since the enlightenment age.\\
