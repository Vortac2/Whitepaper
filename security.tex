\section{Gridcoin Security}

Gridcoin security relies on the fact that Gridcoin is an Open Source derivate of Bitcoin: it inherits Bitcoin's security which is unbroken since creation of Bitcoin. Gridcoin Proof of Stake is the hardened Blackcoin version [44], more secure than Peercoin [2].\\ 

If a BOINC account is hacked and its owner is unaware of Gridcoin, so that its email, password and CPID are known to the attacker, the attacker can receive gains of the unaware BOINC user by sending a beacon with the compromised CPID linked to the attacker's wallet, collecting gridcoins for work done by a BOINC user unaware of gridcoin existence.\\

However, although unfortunate, the previous event will never disrupt the inherently secure transactional mechanism of Gridcoin's blockchain ensuring that people holding and transactions stay secure. Gridcoin blockchain is operating smoothless since 2014 and there were never events which disrupted the way Gridcoin operates. As any other cryptocurrency, Gridcoin remains vulnerable to a 51\% attack, but a vibrant community aroud Gridcoin stays vigilant and will make sure this will never happen.
